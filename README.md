# hiring-cloud
This repo is used during techincal interviews for infrastructure candidates.  The main branch is empty and it's not intended to ever contain code.  There are PR's opened against the main branch that contain terraform code that is broken or does not follow best practices.  The purpose of this repo is to allow the candidate to review one of the open PR's during an interview to demonstrate knowledge of terraform, aws, and other knowledge applicable to the position.
